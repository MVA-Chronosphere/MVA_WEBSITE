ild a fully responsive, elegant, and professional school website for Macro Vision Academy (MVA) using React with TypeScript (.tsx). The design must follow a blue and white color scheme, inspired by the clean, modern aesthetic of https://www.dais.edu.in/aboutus.html .

Do not reduce, summarize, or omit any content—include every single item exactly as listed below, in the exact order provided. Use diverse, non-card-only layouts: consider timelines, full-width sections, image galleries (for drone shots), embedded video placeholders, accordions, multi-column grids, hero banners, and interactive elements where appropriate.

The navbar must be global (shared across all pages), sticky/fixed at the top, mobile-responsive (hamburger menu on small screens), and include all main items with dropdowns as specified. Ensure smooth scrolling, hover effects, and transitions for a premium feel.

Use TypeScript interfaces for structured data (e.g., for leadership team, achievements, etc.), and organize components logically (e.g., Navbar.tsx, Footer.tsx, AboutUsPage.tsx, etc.).

Color Theme: Primary = shades of blue (#003366, #0055A4, #1E88E5); Secondary = white, light gray backgrounds; Accent = subtle gold or teal if needed for highlights.

Typography: Clean, modern sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Poppins, or system fonts).

All pages and sections must include the following content in full:
